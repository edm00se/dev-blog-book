<p>You&apos;ll notice I&apos;ve an extra feature to my CustRestConsumer class. On being invoked, it validates the string according to the <a href="http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-validator/apidocs/org/apache/commons/validator/UrlValidator.html" target="_blank">Apache Commons URLValidator</a>. If it fails this, my class returns a JsonObject with property <em>error</em> set to <em>true</em> and the exception message. If it&apos;s successful, it just establishes the URLConnection, receives the InputStream and via the StringBuffer puts the response out into my <em>myRestData</em> JsonObject via the JsonParser. Please feel free to use and/or modify as you need and, as usual, if someone has a better way of doing it, I&apos;d love to see it. </p>

<p>I&apos;ve used two <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JAR_(file_format" target="_blank">Java ARchive resources (JARs)</a>) in my example CustRestConsumer class.

Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of computer architecture.
