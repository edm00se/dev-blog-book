<p>This is a quick post, covering something I overheard while at MWLUG and comes back to some application architectural principles which I have a bit of a passion for.

I added a bit from a tweet by Tony McGuckin about the <a href="../GLOSSARY.html#xpages" class="glossary-term" title="XPages is a rapid web and mobile application development technology. It allows data from IBM Notes and Relational Databases to be displayed to browser clients on all platforms.

<h3 id="back-to-the-grind-after-mwlug">Back to the Grind After MWLUG</h3>
<p>There&apos;s an intersting slump I experience after getting back from a conference. Not only do I get to clear out of the mountain of things that seem to crop up only while I&apos;m out of the office, but it seems that I&apos;m able to come away from such a gathering with other developers with lots of great ideas for both my growth as a developer but also for what I&apos;m able to accomplish for my company and its users that it&apos;s a nearly unbearable amount to be able to extract from my own head, but I try. For this last week though, I just worked the tasks at hand.</p>

<p>While at MWLUG, I overheard someone make a reference to people &quot;not liking POST&quot; as an HTTP request. I&apos;m fairly certain it may have been said in jest as <a href="xpages/rest-is-best">a blog post I wrote previously</a> talked about &quot;classical&quot; <a href="../GLOSSARY.html#ajax" class="glossary-term" title="AJAX (short for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a set of web development techniques utilizing many web technologies used on the client-side to create asynchronous Web applications. With Ajax, web applications can send data to and retrieve from a server asynchronously (in the background) without interfering with the display and behavior of the existing page. By decoupling the data interchange layer from the presentation layer, Ajax allows for web pages, and by extension web applications, to change content dynamically without the need to reload the entire page. Data can be retrieved using the XMLHttpRequest object. Despite the name, the use of XML is not required (JSON is often used in the AJAJ variant), and the requests do not need to be asynchronous.">AJAX</a>-y requests containing markup (specifically analagous to an <a href="../GLOSSARY.html#xpages" class="glossary-term" title="XPages is a rapid web and mobile application development technology.

<p><strong>Transporting markup in our post-page load XHRs is inefficient</strong>; regardless of whether we call them <a href="../GLOSSARY.html#ajax" class="glossary-term" title="AJAX (short for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a set of web development techniques utilizing many web technologies used on the client-side to create asynchronous Web applications. With Ajax, web applications can send data to and retrieve from a server asynchronously (in the background) without interfering with the display and behavior of the existing page. By decoupling the data interchange layer from the presentation layer, Ajax allows for web pages, and by extension web applications, to change content dynamically without the need to reload the entire page. Data can be retrieved using the XMLHttpRequest object. Despite the name, the use of XML is not required (JSON is often used in the AJAJ variant), and the requests do not need to be asynchronous.">AJAX</a> calls, partial refreshes, or whatever. That&apos;s my bottom line. I don&apos;t think POST as an HTTP method is inferior (they&apos;re just HTTP methods), but to add to a request&apos;s body content, just so we can get a small data update in the screen, when we could otherwise have our data providing the same response just in how we build our URI from a simple GET, the logic seems clear to me.</p>
