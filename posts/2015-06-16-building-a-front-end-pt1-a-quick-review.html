While most <a href="../GLOSSARY.html#java" class="glossary-term" title="Java is a general-purpose computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented, and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.

Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of computer architecture.

<p>A <a href="../GLOSSARY.html#rest" class="glossary-term" title="In computing, Representational State Transfer (REST) is the software architectural style of the World Wide Web. REST gives a coordinated set of constraints to the design of components in a distributed hypermedia system that can lead to a higher-performing and more maintainable architecture. To the extent that systems conform to the constraints of REST they can be called RESTful. RESTful systems typically, but not always, communicate over HTTP with the same HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) which web browsers use to retrieve web pages and to send data to remote servers. REST interfaces with external systems using resources identified by URI, for example /people/tom, which can be operated upon using standard verbs, such as DELETE /people/tom.">REST</a> <a href="../GLOSSARY.html#api" class="glossary-term" title="In computer programming, an application programming interface (API) is a set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software applications.

The principle is that a client interacts with a network application entirely through hypermedia provided dynamically by application servers. A REST client needs no prior knowledge about how to interact with any particular application or server beyond a generic understanding of hypermedia. By contrast, in some service-oriented architectures (SOA), clients and servers interact through a fixed interface shared through documentation or an interface description language (IDL).">HATEOAS</a></span></li>

As you can see, this is part of the core of the segregation of data and primary business logic from the client-layer side of the application.</p>
<h5 id="stack-development">&quot;Stack&quot; Development</h5>
<p>Part of my crusade in the realm of segregating application development concerns into the front-end and back-end revolves around the concept of these &quot;ends&quot; to the application. Both play an important role, but work best together. By building your back-end to adhere to certain conventions, you can create your front-end with any front-end technology. This is why I&apos;m such a huge fan. At my company, we have a large number of in-house systems, many of which talk to each other. By segregating the primary business logic (governing how we store the data, events that trigger from the server, and steps in workflow) as being a part of how the server components work, then any client playing by the rules can be a valid interface; whether that&apos;s an automated agent which checks for non-interface updates, or the front-end which contains all the user interaction at the UI level. The business logic become much more maintainable and documentable in the process.</p>

<p>For now, I&apos;m rocking the 1.x line, specifically staying in 1.3.x for my current app. A lot of people are trying to make a big deal out of Google&apos;s choice to break 2.x from 1.x, but the fact of the matter is that 1.x isn&apos;t going anywhere just yet and will have a stable branch for quite some time to come. I first started dabbling on <a href="../GLOSSARY.html#angularjs" class="glossary-term" title="AngularJS (commonly referred to as &quot;Angular&quot; or &quot;Angular.js&quot;) is an open-source web application framework mainly maintained by Google and by a community of individual developers and corporations to address many of the challenges encountered in developing single-page applications.

If I was so inclined, there is a stable 1.0.8 release available right on <a href="../GLOSSARY.html#angularjs" class="glossary-term" title="AngularJS (commonly referred to as &quot;Angular&quot; or &quot;Angular.js&quot;) is an open-source web application framework mainly maintained by Google and by a community of individual developers and corporations to address many of the challenges encountered in developing single-page applications.

<p>So, all those naysayers, I say pick a framework. I&apos;m going with <a href="../GLOSSARY.html#angularjs" class="glossary-term" title="AngularJS (commonly referred to as &quot;Angular&quot; or &quot;Angular.js&quot;) is an open-source web application framework mainly maintained by Google and by a community of individual developers and corporations to address many of the challenges encountered in developing single-page applications.
