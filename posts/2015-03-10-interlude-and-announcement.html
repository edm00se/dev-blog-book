<p>Over the last week or so, I started to run into an issue I had trouble quantifying.

It&apos;s a credit to this community and one of the reasons that this blog exists. When David Leedy suggested those with anything they could share, ought to, it hit home as I&apos;ve benefited greatly from the work of others.</p>
<h5 id="the-issue">The Issue</h5>
<p>I shifted my development environment to a new vm and, while doing some actual code work in preparation for the next post in the servlet series, I noticed that my servlets that depended <em>DesignerFacesServlet</em> had stopped working. After consulting with Jesse Gallagher, there seems to be some issues with ClassLoader outside of <a href="../GLOSSARY.html#xpages" class="glossary-term" title="XPages is a rapid web and mobile application development technology.

<p>So, it seems that while I can keep my JARs in <install>/<a href="../GLOSSARY.html#jvm" class="glossary-term" title="A Java virtual machine (JVM) is an abstract computing machine that enables a computer to run a Java program.">jvm</a>/lib/ext/, it </install><em>also</em> seems that I need to continue to apply the <em>lady-of-the-evening</em> approach to my <a href="../GLOSSARY.html#java" class="glossary-term" title="Java is a general-purpose computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented, and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.

I&apos;ve tried to find ways of keeping that from being necessary, but it seems that if you want <em>FacesContext</em> access in your servlet, you should either add that back in, or roll your servlet as an OSGi servlet; an approach I&apos;ve yet to get into, though <a href="8b30b0.wordpress.com">Jason Hook seems to have covered the topic a bit</a>. For those concerned about this edit, I would recommend that the requirements of your servlet (should it require <em>FacesContext</em>, which is very likely) include having security permissions. If the admin(s) of whoever owns the server can&apos;t think of a better way, then they should roll the above line, otherwise they can manage that as-needed. If someone knows of a better way around this, please don&apos;t keep it to yourself.</p>

<h3 id="an-announcement">An Announcement</h3>
<p>Speaking of my blog, I am migrating to a new domain name. Don&apos;t worry, all your existing bookmarks and feed links will work, as it will be the same blog hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a>. My link references will be updating and the Disqus comments migrating. From here on out, I can save myself a few characters here and there:</p>

<h3 id="a-second-announcement">A Second Announcement</h3>
<p>Recording has begun! I&apos;m hoping that my efforts will be fruitful to people in the <s>years?</s> months to come, but I also know that many people learn better by seeing instead of reading. My blog can get a bit wordy at times, something I try to keep at bay, but in preparation for the end stages of my servlet series, I have recorded the first few pieces of the companion <a href="../GLOSSARY.html#notes" class="glossary-term" title="IBM Notes (formerly Lotus Notes) is a client of a collaborative client-server software platform sold by IBM.">Notes</a> in 9 episode to-be. It was suggested by some previously and is something I plan on delivering in conjunction with the end of my series.</p>
<p>Until next time, <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="cheers!">:beers:</span>.</p>
