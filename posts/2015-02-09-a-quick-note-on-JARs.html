<a href="xpages/a-quick-note-on-JARs#comment-1872739749">In the comments, Sven Petri pointed out</a> the need to have the JAR in the same relative path in the Designer environment conducting any build of the NSF.

<p>Either I just didn&apos;t know that this was a viable option or we&apos;ve all been living in the dark for too long. My suspicion is the former, but what follows is a quick run down of my preferred approach for using the <em>com.google.<a href="../GLOSSARY.html#gson" class="glossary-term" title="Gson (also known as Google Gson) is an open source Java library to serialize and deserialize Java objects to (and from) JSON.">gson</a></em> library (or any JAR), server-wide (without OSGi deployment).

<h3 id="what">What?</h3>
<p>While preparing for my <span data-toggle-tooltip="" title="I swear it&apos;s coming!">impending blog series on servlets</span>, I&apos;ve been hammering out a couple of details regarding external dependencies (aka- JAR files). The short story is that I assumed things had to be a certain way (including the <a href="../GLOSSARY.html#java" class="glossary-term" title="Java is a general-purpose computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented, and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.

<h3 id="why">Why?</h3>
<p>It seems that setting up what I regard as server elements, even these add-on ones, is something I don&apos;t do every day. Any developer can see quickly that re-importing the same JAR file you use across your application instances can become quite tedious, quickly. But it would seem that there is a better way of doing things than just importing your JAR to each NSF and needing to add a line on the server (in <install>/<a href="../GLOSSARY.html#jvm" class="glossary-term" title="A Java virtual machine (JVM) is an abstract computing machine that enables a computer to run a Java program.">jvm</a>/lib/security/<a href="../GLOSSARY.html#java" class="glossary-term" title="Java is a general-purpose computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented, and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.

<p>As is inevitable with such things, there is a caveat to the use of the <install>/<a href="../GLOSSARY.html#jvm" class="glossary-term" title="A Java virtual machine (JVM) is an abstract computing machine that enables a computer to run a Java program.">jvm</a>/lib/ext/ path for JAR inclusion, primarily revolving around any libraries which are already a part of <a href="../GLOSSARY.html#domino" class="glossary-term" title="IBM Domino (formerly Lotus Domino) is the server of a collaborative client-server software platform sold by IBM.">Domino</a>.</install></p>

<p>Ultimately, I&apos;m aiming to get into OSGi plugins for a first go by including my hit list of usual JAR files, so I can import them on a per-project basis. For example, if I&apos;m building out a RESTful end point with <a href="../GLOSSARY.html#gson" class="glossary-term" title="Gson (also known as Google Gson) is an open source Java library to serialize and deserialize Java objects to (and from) JSON.">GSON</a>, I&apos;m also probably using a couple Apache Commons libraries.
